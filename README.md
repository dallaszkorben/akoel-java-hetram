Two dimensional modelling of Steady state Heat Conduction

This program helps you to model the steady-state 2 dimensional heat conduction in a 2D structural cross-section.

There are 3 modes in the system:

1. Drawing mode - you can put the structural element on the canvas. The boundary conditions can be set by drawing lines around the elements using the Open Edge (Î±, T) and the Symmetric Edge (q=0) elements. Clicking on the Calculate button the program gets into the Calculate mode
2. Calculate mod - the program calculates the temperatures of the so called "thermic points". When the calculation has finished you get into the Analyse mode
3. Analyse mode - you can get the following data in all thermic points
Temperatures by value
Temperature by colors
Heat flux vectors
Heat flux Trajectories

Advatages:

Easy to draw a simple 2D building structure
Simple method to define 2nd and 3rd species thermal boundary conditions (Symmetric edge, Open edge)
It is possible to set a thermic edge all along with variable alpha
You can check the direction and the relative magnitude of the heat flux in the thermic points
